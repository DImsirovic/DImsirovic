# About Me

Hi, I'm Dinko!

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a degree in Data Science. I'm passionate about turning data into insight and working not just as an analyst, but as a technologist, organizer, and communicator dedicated to bringing together technology, business, and strategy.

If you enjoy what you see here and would like to have a chat about my portfolio or work opportunities, let's connect [on LinkedIn ðŸ˜„](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinko-imsirovic/)
