## My Projects
* ![Wikipedia Search Engine | Python](https://github.com/DImsirovic/wiki_search)
  * Implemented an end-to-end scalable search engine for Wikipedia articles with MapReduce
  * Developed a RESTful API to rank results of user queries with PageRank and tf-idf analysis
  * Created a user interface with tunable weights

*Tools: MapReduce, Flask, Jinja*
  
* ![Monte Carlo Simulations - March Madness | R](https://github.com/DImsirovic/march_madness_monte_carlo)
  * Demonstrated difference in distribution of 3 point field goal percentage for seeded versus non-seeded teams in March Madness
  * Justified use of permutational t-test with power analysis through Monte Carlo Simulations
  * Published [Medium article](https://medium.com/@Dinko-Imsirovic/march-madness-a-case-study-in-monte-carlo-simulation-b6ee9cce52e1) demonstrating effective and clear communication of advanced statistical concepts

*Tools: dplyr, ggplot2*

## In Progress
* [College Football Game Prediction | Python, SQL](https://github.com/DImsirovic/cfb_game_prediction)
	* Goal: Predict winner of a college football game given season average statistics, talent, and returning production
	* Goal: Deploy model to Streamlit, allowing users to select any 2 teams from the CFP era (2015-present) to predict winner of hypothetical matchup

*Tools: Web Scraping, Pandas, Scikit-Learn*

## Coming Soon!
These machine learning projects are currently underway and I'm very excited to share them upon completion
* Spotify Popularity Prediction | Python
	* Goal: Predict how popular a song will become on Spotify given characteristics such as danceability, energy, key, etc.

*Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn*
